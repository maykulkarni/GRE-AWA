Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.

For: 
1. Education institutes have experience, as they've seen people rise and fall based on the fields students choose (based on job, career opportunities)
2. Depends on the way the decide on whether or not a student will succeed. It might not give a true result of students' capabilities.

Against:
1. Student may be bad at this point of time, doesn't mean he'll be bad forever.
2. Definition of success is a different for different individuals. 

Conclusion: 
Let the student decide for what he wants on his own, while taking the help of the experience built by the educational organization.

A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

For:
1. Everyone should have basic education, for instance Math, English which are essential for day to day life.
2. Similar national curriculum will aid a fairer judgement system, and examination standards for students. Eg. IIT JEE exams.

Against:
1. Will be biased for handicapped students. 
2. Some schools might not afford the infrastructure needed. Eg. CS course would necessitate computers which schools in rural areas might not afford.  

Conclusion:
Major portion of the curriculum should be kept same, while giving freedom to some extent to the colleges, so as to keep in mind the audience they are educating (schools for blinds, for instance).

Goverment should offer partial help, and then give part time jobs to students so that they can earn and learn at the same time.
Government can also start accepting donations to help poor students.

2. Will cost time and money to the student which he might not have. 

Conclusion:
Universities that necessitate students to take more than 10 subjects a semesters seems unfair. However, it should set a curriculum of few core must take subjects, and must recommend courses that might benefit the student, or present a number of courses as electives and let the student decide on which courses to take 	based on his requirements and future endeavours.

2. If too many students are trained for fields with lucrative jobs, the field will get overcrowded and lose quality and opulence, the very basis for choosing the field.

Conclusion: Universities should recommend lucrative fields and courses, but should leave the decision on the students to choose the path.

Against:
1. Questioning everything (indicated by 'always') is ludicrous since if you waste your time questioning the laws of basic physics you'll just end up wasting your time

Conclusion:
It is good to get into a healthy discussion with your professor in case you have doubts but questioning 'always' is a not a very wise thing to do.
